# This should also avoid having to go through flake-compat, which has troubles with submodules
#
# It also makes it be based on the same nixpkgs as everything else rather than what the flake says. For better and worse.
# If it ever becomes a problem I suppose I can figure out a way to hack it together differently.

# To use this put this file into imports.
